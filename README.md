# MNIST Digit Recognizer - Kaggle Competition (SCORE: 0.98964)
Welcome to this Google Colab notebook for the MNIST Digit Identification Kaggle competition!

https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview

## Overview
Competition: Classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset
Dataset: 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits 
Goal: Develop a model to accurately predict the digit in each image

## Notebook Contents
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Preprocessing and data augmentation
3. K-Fold Cross-Validation
4. Model building (CNN architecture)
5. Training and evaluation
6. Prediction and submission generation

## Key Features
Implement K-Fold Cross-Validation to:

* Assess model performance more robustly
* Reduce overfitting
* Provide insights into model stability across different data subsets
